# Project Profiler

This project aims to perform static analysis of Git repositories,
either from local clones or by cloning them from GitHub.

Among the available analysis we currently have:

- Analysis of each commits (tags, classifications, ...).
- Analysis of file ownership (75% of commits on a specific file).
